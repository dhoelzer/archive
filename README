This project is a proof of concept demonstrating how to go about creating a database driven application
for managing arbitrary sets of data for which the metadata is not predefined.  Instead, the user has
the ability to create metadata relationships and types that are associated with various types of records
and subsequently stored in the database.

This approach also means that searches can be performed across all of the metadata simultaneously since
the application takes the approach that, "It's all data to me!"
